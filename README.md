## Brief

For this assignment you will be working on your own or in groups to design and produce a LEGO game in Unity.

As a software developer you should be able to work as a team when developing a game. As a group you will be responsible for completing this project and as individuals you will each have responsibility for your own micro game within the main game. 

As a group you will need to select a genre and subject that is out of copyright that you can build as a LEGO game. For example Sherlock Holmes , Tarzan or Dracula. Plus any other number of characters in books or films. You must select wisely as a group as you will need to build a world in LEGO for that story.

You will create a narrative within the game that tells part of the characters story. You will all need to help in developing the main game which you will decide on using the available online tutorials. Your main focus will be to create a mini game that reflects a part of the world taken for the story’s in your out of copyright books or film.  You are welcome to produce more than one micro game,  but you will need to plan your schedule to reduce the amount of time spent on the research, experimentation and the reflection phases so you can focus more time on the development stage. This is not to say you can skip these stages, only that you need to work to a faster schedule than the one we work to in our lessons.

As part of the criteria (3.1 Apply academic conventions in the production and presentation of ideas.) You will need to investigate a facet of video game design and write a **short essay** on your findings. It is expected that students should produce a piece of extended writing of a minimum of 1,500 words.

## 

## 1\. GATHER

### 1.1 Critically describe a range of contextual perspectives influencing a chosen discipline in creative media production. 

**TASKS**

Start by analysing the brief and create a response to the brief proposal. For this you will need to complete the following:

* Undertake an analysis of the brief   
* Create a mind maps of ideas  
* Identify the PURPOSE, CONTEXT, CONSTRAINTS and EXPECTATIONS and finally the PRESENTATION FORMAT (eg Web, iOS, Android etc)  
* Identify the chosen audience and the type of games they play.  
* Present a proposal to your mini-game solution to the class  
* Create a project proposal (link to your Project Proposal)

| IMPORTANT: We will meet to discuss your ideas at the end of the week. If you can’t attend then please forward your ideas/presentation for the rest of the group to discuss. Please note however you will forfeit your voting rights on the game genre and subject. |

## 

## 2\. RESEARCH

### 1.2 Apply knowledge of critical perspectives to inform your own practice. 

**TASKS**

For this task you will need to look into the history of game design and current cultural influences, artists and cultures. 

You should broaden your research. How have other artists tackled difficult subjects? Investigate [multiculturalism](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/587), [diversity](https://www.qualitycomix.com/learn/superhero-diversity-in-comic-books), [inclusion](https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2021/07/comic-conhome-diversity-and-comics-why-inclusion-and-visibility-matter/), [race](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/01/11/261449394/who-gets-to-be-a-superhero-race-and-identity-in-comics?t=1642626482593), [religion](https://www.deseret.com/2013/11/29/20530513/superheroes-and-faith-how-religion-plays-a-role-in-the-comic-book-industry#experts-say-religious-comics-like-the-christian-comic-book-archangels-displayed-to-the-left-help-people-transcend-past-the-pages-and-delve-deeper-into-their-own-faith-as-well-as-religions-they-dont-understand-completely-kim-raff-deseret-morning-news-october-10-2006), [social](https://bookriot.com/social-justice-comics/), [political](https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/1/9/20995875/politics-in-comics-dc-marvel-superman-trump-lois-lane-art-spiegelman), [environmental](https://libguides.sdsu.edu/comicsbytopic/sustainability) and [ethical contexts](https://www.academia.edu/8674316/Comics_and_Ethics) and apply this knowledge in producing your critical perspectives for the 21st century.

You should be able to find more articles on each of these subjects. Gather a few quotes and examples from as many websites or books as you can.

Your next task is to evaluate your research and cull/filter   
down your ideas and select the topics that  most interest you.. 

Don’t forget to reference your research using the [Harvard Method](https://www.citethisforme.com/). 

You need to identify your target audience. First identify your audience using the following headings:    

* **Demographics** \= classification of people according to facts about an audience  \- Age, Gender, Culture, Race, Religion, Nationality, Location, Socio-economic Level  
* **Psychographics** \= classification of people according to attitudes and psychological criteria \- Interests, Lifestyles, Opinions and desires  
* **Experiences** \= what people have experienced in a relevant genre in the past.  
* **Expectations** \=  how people might expect to be affected by a media product.

* [https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/312430/How\_devs\_design\_the\_Lego\_games\_to\_appeal\_to\_all\_ages.php](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/312430/How_devs_design_the_Lego_games_to_appeal_to_all_ages.php)

Write up a short article on the intended target audience for your game.  
(minimum of 300 words) 

| IMPORTANT: Your images and references  must be cited. i.e. Where did you get this image/fact from?  All research references/imagery needs to have the website address referenced immediately underneath the reference/imagery. Use the [Harvard Referencing](https://www.citethisforme.com/uk/referencing-generator/harvard) system. |
| :---- |

Once you have analysed the target audience needs and requirements you should complete the list below:

1. Planning exercises \- mindmaps, moodboards, formstorming and thumbnails    
2. 3 x research pages with analysis and materials, techniques and processes emulation  
3. History of the subject (films / TV /Books  / Games / Comics Etc)  
4. Examples of LEGO games   
5. Examples of mini / micro games

| NOTE: This would also be a good time to explore the online LEGO [tutorials](https://learn.unity.com/project/lego-template). This forms part of your research so record the time spent with screenshots of your progress. |
| :---- |

Lastly you need to show planning of your time. Below are a couple of examples you might use.

1. Gantt chart   
2. Risk assessment  
   

## 3\. Planning

### 2.1 Identify a range of relevant academic and cultural sources for a personal research project. 

#### **Planning your microgame**

Building on the research you have done for your individual micro game you will now need to plan out your idea. If you're still stuck, see if you can find a puzzle game as the basis for your idea.

You should think of tasks which use **Cryptography, Maps, Puzzles** and anything that you think would be relevant for your character (for example in the case of Sherlock or Dracula)\!

**TASKS**

Once you have chosen your idea it is time to start the planning stage\! This will require you to plan out your ideas as simple diagrams and flowcharts

## 

## 4\. Design

### 3.2 Effectively communicate ideas in appropriate formats.

**TASKS**

If you haven’t already done so, your first task will be to complete all the tutorials on building a LEGO micro game on the Unity [website](https://learn.unity.com/project/lego-template). Make sure you record the time spent completing this task.

You now need to design your micro game based on all the research you did for the previous task. If you have done task two correctly you now have an exciting collection of research material. Now try applying your research into your designs. In designing your micro game idea you must use examples of actual games you have played  and show a real understanding of how simple or difficult these ideas will be to reproduce.  This stage needs to be signed off by all the other members of the team before you start the next stage.

For the main game you will also work in teams of a maximum of three and each team will be responsible for a main game level. As a team you need to decide who is developing which level.

| IMPORTANT: Each of you must make a different micro game within the main game. You will need to discuss your ideas so that no two micro games are similar. |
| :---- |

### 

### 2.1 Identify a range of relevant academic and cultural sources for a personal research project. 

You will need to show a basic understanding of the history of game design. This should include historical story-telling, through to video games. You should also investigate game narrative story-telling.  Build a bibliography of reference material from academic and cultural sources. These can include tutorials and articles, portfolios and journals. 

As you complete your Lego game you now need to focus on creating a version of your story using cinemachine to create cutscenes. Create 3x examples with different  techniques and processes.

### 

**TASKS** \- ***Real Time Story-Telling***

You will develop pre-visualization skills, learn to create an environment and props, animate characters, film a story, and refine your game scene with lighting and effects. As an game developer and storyteller, you will learn how to leverage one of the most powerful new technologies to bring your ideas to life in real-time. 

As you complete the creative challenges and develop your own project, you’ll be able to share your new skills in your portfolio. Whether you’re a student who wants to be at the forefront of the entertainment industry, or a professional looking to upskill, by the end of this course you will have developed in-demand game design skills to make you stand out from the crowd.

## 5\. MAKE

### 3.2 Effectively communicate ideas in appropriate formats.

**TASKS**

You will now apply your practical skills to develop your micro game and the different levels within the main game. You will need to discuss the order of the micro games but it would be fairer if a micro game was selected at random after each level. 

Each of you will also need to create a wide range of LEGO objects for inclusion in your game which need to be shared. You might want to create a list of objects and characters required and assign this task out equally.

| IMPORTANT: Please give yourself as much time as possible to complete this stage in your Gantt chart as this is the most time consuming stage.  |
| :---- |

## 6\. Evaluate

### 2.2 Critically evaluate information from a range of sources to inform ideas. 

Conclude your project with a critical review of approx. 400 words. This should relate to your research and show how your work meets the audience's needs/requirements? 

What problems did you encounter and how did you try to solve them?

* Identify (say or list contents)  
* Describe (relate the characteristics of the contents)  
* Discuss (explore, give a range of viewpoints or interpretations)  
* Explain (link, provide reasons how, why)  
* Evaluate (assess its functionality and aesthetic success)

You now need to show your successes and failings in this assignment. This is not to pick holes in your project but to identify things that can be improved next time round. Using the Gibb reflection methods reflect on the work produced to gain an understanding of your own personal development.

**TASKS**

Reflect on your project with a critical review of approx. 200 words. 

* Discuss what went well and explain why?   
* What problems did you encounter and how did you try to solve them?  
* Evaluation and creation of SMART targets for the next project

### 3.1 Apply academic conventions in the production and presentation of ideas. 

For this task you will need to investigate a facet of story-telling and write a short essay on your findings. It is expected that students should produce a piece of extended writing of a minimum of 1,500 words.

**NOTE:**  All the previous assignment criteria should show that you have considered academic conventions in the production and presentation of your Lego game. Your short essay should use the Harvard Referencing Method.

### 3.2 Effectively communicate ideas in appropriate formats.

You will now need to critically evaluate your solution against your brief. This means you need to show your successes and failings in this assignment. This is not to pick holes in your project but to identify things that can be improved next time round. Using the Gibb reflection methods reflect on the work produced to gain an understanding of your own personal development.

**TASKS**

Conclude your project with a critical review which should include:

* Discuss what went well and explain why?   
* What problems did you encounter and how did you try to solve them?  
* Identify (say or list contents)  
* Describe (relate the characteristics of the contents)  
* Discuss (explore, give a range of viewpoints or interpretations)  
* Explain (link, provide reasons how, why)  
* Evaluate (assess its functionality and aesthetic success)  
* Reflect on  your project with a critical review of approx.   
* What problems did you encounter and how did you try to solve them?  
* Evaluation and creation of SMART targets for the next project.

| IMPORTANT: Your references must be cited. i.e. Where did you get this article from?  All research imagery needs to have the website address referenced immediately underneath imagery.  |
| :---- |

**WHAT IS A CRITICAL REVIEW?** 

A **critical review** is much more than a simple summary; it is an **analysis** and **evaluation** of your work. A **critical review** evaluates **the** strengths and weaknesses of your ideas and content. It provides description, **analysis** and interpretation that assess **the** solutions value.

It should include:

* Critically review and evaluate your planning, organisation and management of the project in the context of the theme   
* Review and evaluate your use of different research sources and how these helped to develop and support your ideas.   
* Review and evaluate your use of your sketchbook and additional 2D/3D digital and or photographic work in the exploration and development of your ideas   
* Review your ability to problem-solve both materially and theoretically.   
* Critically review and evaluate your exploration and experimentation of materials, techniques & processes in the realisation of your outcomes so far.
